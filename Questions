In rmd file 3-allometry, lines 330-348, the PGLS fit line in the scatterplot is way off of the actual data points. Does this mean that the PGLS 
analysis is not fitting the data accurately, or is there a problem with the code? We had this problem before with other comparisons I believe, 
but this is the only one that seems off now.

In rmd file 7-PGLS analyis I am unsure which method to use to get significance values for testing for differences in eye size across the ecological states. 
I started by testing for normality,but since it is such a large sample size it is not surprising that the Shapiro Wilks test is picking up some deviation. 
However, visually the histogram looks normally distributed. For the frog paper, you used the non-parametric alternative, Kruskal-Wallis tests. Could you look 
at the assumptions tests starting at line 87 and see if it makes more sense to do an ANOVA versus the Kruskal-Wallis or Tukey versus Dunn tests?

In 5-phylogeny plots I am trying to plot the phylogeny next to bar plots of cornea diameter and investment that are colored by habitat, activity period, larval
habitat, and development for the supplementary material. I have been trying to outline the bars in black like you have in the frog supplementary material, but I 
have been unsuccessful. The error message is: Error in order(res$y) : argument 1 is not a vector. I have a TEST section starting at line 265 where I have tried to 
fix this issue, but the same error message keeps popping up. It is not recognizing y as a column. Any ideas on a different way to outline the barplots or what could 
be going wrong here?
