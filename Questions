In rmd file 1-tidy_data, line 80, when I merge salamanders.subset and traits.subset, all of the ecological classifications for Hynobius naevius 
are showing up as NA values. This is the only species this is a problem for. Before merging, both datasets have all of the correct information. 
I am not sure what is happening here.

In rmd file 3-allometry, lines 330-348, the PGLS fit line in the scatterplot is way off of the actual data points. Does this mean that the PGLS 
analysis is not fitting the data accurately, or is there a problem with the code? We had this problem before with other comparisons I believe, 
but this is the only one that seems off now.

In rmd file 4-eye_investments, lines 245-310, I plot the phylogeny showing species means for absolute eye diameter and eye investment relative to 
body mass. However, only the tree and legend are plotting. The absolute and relative eye sizes and adult habitats are not showing up in the graph. 
I followed your code in anuran_eye_size_copy.rmd with some modifications, and I am not sure where I am going wrong.

In rmd file 6-PGLS analyis I am unsure which method to use to get significance values for testing for differences in eye size across the ecological states. 
I started by testing for normality,but since it is such a large sample size it is not surprising that the Shapiro Wilks test is picking up some deviation. 
However, visually the histogram looks normally distributed. For the frog paper, you used the non-parametric alternative, Kruskal-Wallis tests. Could you look 
at the assumptions tests starting at line 78 and see if it makes more sense to do an ANOVA versus the Kruskal-Wallis or Tukey versus Pairwise Wilcox Rank Sum tests?
